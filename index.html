          <h4>Epicodus uses the pair-programming approach to learning. Here is a short excerpt from the Epicodus website:</h4>
          <blockquote>
            <em>Most class days, you'll practice pair programming: two people sharing one computer, taking turns who uses the keyboard and mouse. By working together, you catch each other's mistakes, teach each other new skills, and come up with ideas together neither of you would have had alone. Pairing is increasingly used by tech companies (like Facebook and Square), and we've found that pair programming helps you learn faster, too.</em>
          </blockquote>
          <h4>It is 100% necessary to be able to work with others at Epicodus, and you will not be able to succeed here without that ability. Please rethink your answer if you wish to continue using the Track Suggestor.</h4>

        <h1 class="seekHelp">I'm sorry to hear about that. You are  probably in need of serious help.. oh well.</h1>
        <h1 class="general">If money is all that you're after, you can probably just close your eyes and pick one. Learning any programming language can be a lucrative investment.</h1>
